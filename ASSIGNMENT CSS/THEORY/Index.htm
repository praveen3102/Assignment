        <h1>CSS ASSIGNMENT</h1>
    <h1>1. What are the benefits of using CSS</h1>
    <p>--It allows developers to style fonts, colours, spacing, borders, backgrounds, and more,
        making it possible to create visually appealing and consistent designs across multiple
        web pages.</p>
        <p>--With the help of CSS, web developers can achieve responsive web design,
            consistent branding, improved user experience, and easier maintenance
            of their websites</p>
            <br>
            <h1>2. What are the disadvantages of CSS?</h1>
            <p>– Different web browsers may interpret CSS rules differently, leading to inconsistent
                rendering and layout discrepancies across browsers. <br> Ensuring cross-browser
                compatibility can be time-consuming and may require additional workarounds for
                specific browser issues. <br>
               <p> – Implementing responsive designs with CSS can become complex, especially when
                dealing with multiple breakpoints and screen sizes</p>
                <br>
                <h1>3. What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h1>
                <p>The CSS3 version supports more browsers than CSS2. CSS3 introduces
                    several new selectors. Those new selectors square measure largely in an
                    exceeding type of pseudo-elements and pseudo-categories.
                    </p>
                    <p>– CSS2 introduced many new features compared to CSS1, including positioning,
                        floats, z-index, and support for media types (print, screen, etc.).
                        </p>
                        <p>– CSS3: CSS3 includes a vast array of new features and enhancements across
                            multiple modules. Some notable features in CSS3 include rounded corners <br>
                            gradients, shadows, flexible box layouts, animations, transitions, and media       
                             queries for responsive design
                        </p>
            <h1>4. Name a few CSS style components</h1>
            <p>1 - Typography <br>
                2 - Colors and Backgrounds <br>
                3 - Media Queries <br>
                4 - Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements</p>
                <h1>6. How can the background color of an element be changed?</h1>
                <p>To change the background color of an element using CSS, you can
                    use the background-color property</p>
                    <h3>Ex-</h3>
                    <p>element <br>{ <br>
                        background-color: red; <br>
                    }
                    </p>

                    <h1>7. How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?</h1>
                    <p>To control the repetition of the background image, you can use the
                        background-repeat property in CSS. <br>
                        This property allows you to specify how the background image should be
                        displayed when it doesn't fully cover the background area.</p>

                        <h1>8. What is the use of the background-position property?</h1>
                        <p>The background-position property in CSS is used to control the placement
                            It allows you to specify where the background image should be positioned
                            or positioning of a background image within its containing element.
                            in relation to the element's background area.</p>
                            <h3>The background-position property accepts two values</h3>
                               <h4>1 - Horizontal Position</h4>
                                <h4>2 - Vertical Position</h4>
             <h1>9. Which property controls the image scroll in the Background?</h1>
             <p>By default, the background-attachment property is set to scroll, so the
                background image scrolls with the content. To achieve a fixed background
                image effect, set the value to fixed.</p>       
                <p>element  <br>{ <br>
                    background-image: url("path/to/image.png"); <br>
                    background-attachment: scroll;<br>
                    } <br>
                    .element  <br>{ <br>
                    background-image: url("path/to/image.png"); <br>
                    background-attachment: fixed; <br>
                    }</p>     
                    <h1>10. Why should background and color be used as
                        separate properties?</h1>
                        <p>Using the background and color properties separately allows for more
                            flexibility and control in styling HTML elements. <br> The primary reason to use
                            them separately is that they handle different aspects of the element's
                            Appearance:</p>    
                            <h4>background property-</h4>   
                            <p>The background property is used to set multiple
                                background-related styles, such as background color, background image,background position</p>
                     <h4>color property-</h4>The color property is specifically used to set the text color of
                     an element.
                <h1>11. How to centre block elements using CSS1?</h1>
                <p>.element <br> { <br>
                    width: 50%;<br>
                    margin: 0 auto; <br>
                    text-align: center ; <br>
                    }
                    </p>     
                 <h1>12. How to maintain the CSS specifications?</h1>
                 <p>Maintaining CSS specifications involves several best practices
                    and strategies to ensure consistent,  <br>organised, and efficient CSS
                    code</p>
            <h1>13. What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web
                page?</h1>
                <p>There are several ways to integrate CSS into a web page. Here are the
                    most common methods:</p>   
                    <h4>1 - External CSS</h4>
                     <h4>2 - Internal CSS</h4>
                     <h4>3 - Inline CSS </h4>   
            <h1>14. What are embedded style sheets?</h1>    
            <p>Embedded style sheets, also known as "internal style sheets," are a
                method of including CSS directly within an HTML document. <br> In this approach,
                CSS rules are defined within the < style> element, <br> which is placed in the < head>
                section of the HTML document.  <br>The CSS styles specified inside the < style>
                element apply only to the specific HTML document in which they are
                embedded.
                </p>
        <h1>15. What are the external style sheets?</h1>
        <p>External style sheets are separate CSS files containing styles and rules
            that are stored in separate files from the HTML documents. <br> They allow
            you to define and organise CSS styles independently from the HTML
            content. By using external style sheets</p>
            <p>To use an external style sheet, you create a .css file that contains your
                CSS rules and link it to your HTML documents using the < link> element
                in the < head> section of your HTML.  <br>The < link> element specifies the
                relationship between the HTML document and the external CSS file</p>
        <h1>16. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using
            external style sheets?</h1>
             <h4>Advantages of using external style sheets:</h4>
          <p>Modularity - By keeping CSS rules in separate files, you can organise
            your styles into modules or components, making it easier to
            manage and maintain your codebase.</p>
            <p>Reduced Page Size - By separating CSS from HTML, <br> your HTML
                documents become smaller and more focused on
                content,  <br>improving page loading times and user
                experience</p>
            <h4>Disadvantages of using external style sheets:</h4>
            <p>Dependency - If the external style sheet is missing or not loaded
                correctly, it can result in unstyled content or layout issues
                on the web page.  <br>Ensuring the correct path and file name
                for the CSS link is essential.</p>
            <p>Overhead for Small Projects - For small projects with minimal styling
                needs, using an external style sheet may
                introduce unnecessary complexity.  <br>In such
                cases, inline or internal styles might be
                more straightforward.
                </p>
        <h1>17. What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</h1>
        <p>The CSS selector is a pattern that allows you to target and select specific <br>
            HTML elements on a web page to apply styles or perform other operations.
            </p>
            <p>CSS selectors are the foundation of CSS rules and determine which elements
                the styles will be applied to.  <br>Selectors define the scope or context in which
                CSS rules should be effective</p>
            <h1>18. What are the media types allowed by CSS?</h1>
            <p>CSS allows you to define different styles for different media types, <br>
                enabling you to create styles tailored to specific devices or media.
                </p>
             <h4>1 - all - This is the default media type. Styles defined with the all media type
                apply to all devices.
                </h4>
             <h4>2 - screen - Used for computer screens, tablets, smartphones, and similar
                devices.
                </h4>
             <h4>3 - print - Used for print media, such as when the web page is being printed</h4>
             <h4>4 - Speech - Used for speech synthesisers or screen readers for users with
                Disabilities.</h4>
            <h1>19. What is the rule set?</h1>
            <p>In CSS, a rule set is a collection of one or more CSS declarations that
                define the styles to be applied to one or more HTML elements.</p>
                <p>It consists of a selector and a block of declarations enclosed in curly braces</p>
                Here's an example of a CSS rule set: <br>
                   h1 { <br>
                 color: blue ; <br>
                  font-size: 24px; <br>
                    margin-bottom: 20px; <br>
                        } <br>
