            <li>HTML provides several types of lists that can be used to organise and
                structure content. <br>The three main types of lists in HTML are
                Unordered List (< ul>): An unordered list is a list where the order of items
                does not matter. The list items are typically displayed with bullet points.</li><br>
            <h3>Example</h3>
             <li>< ul></li>
             <p> < li>Item 1< /li><br>
                  < li>Item 2< /li><br>< /ul>

             <p><li>Item 1</li>
                <li>Item 2</li></p>
          <li>Ordered List (< ol>): An ordered list is a list where the order of items
            matters. <br>The list items are typically displayed with sequential numbers or
            letters.</li>
            <h3>Example</h3>

            example</h2></ol>
            <li><p>In HTML, the class attribute is used to assign one or more class names
                to
                an element. <br>It is a way to categorise and classify elements, allowing you
                to
                style and target them using CSS or JavaScript. <br>The class attribute does
                not
                have any predefined meaning or functionality in HTML; <br>it is simply a way
                to
                add semantic information to elements for styling or scripting purposes</p></li>
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>< p class="highlight"> This paragraph has a class of "highlight"< /p> <br>
                    < div class="container">This div has a class of "container" < /div>

                <li>
                    <p>In HTML, both the id and class attributes are used to identify and select
                        specific elements, but they have different purposes and behaviour.
                        id attribute: <br>
                        The id attribute is used to provide a unique identifier for a specific
                        element on a web page. Each id value must be unique within the entire
                        HTML document</p>
                </li>
                <h3>Example:</h3>
                <p>< div id="my-element">This is an element with an ID of "my-element"< /div></p>
                <h6>class attribute</h6>
                <p>he class attribute is used to assign one or more class names to
                    an
                    element. Class names can be shared among multiple elements.</p>
                    <h3>Example:</h3>
                    <p>< p class="highlight">This is a paragraph with a class of

            <h2>8. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?</h2>
            <li>In HTML, there are several formatting tags that can be used to apply
                specific formatting or styling to text and content within a web page.
                Here
                are some of the commonly used formatting tags:</li>
                <p>< b>: Represents bold text.<br>
                    < i>: Represents italicised text.<br>

                With example</h2>
                <li><p>In HTML, cellpadding and cellspacing are attributes used in table
                    elements to control the spacing and padding between cells.<br>
                    cellpadding:
                    The cellpadding attribute is used to specify the amount of space
                    between the content of a table cell and the cell's borders.
                    It adds padding within each cell, pushing the content away from

                    Inline elements do not start on a new line and do not create line breaks

                text and provide structure and meaning to the content. Here are some
                commonly used tags:<br>
                < h1> to < h6>: Heading tags are used to indicate different levels of
                headings or titles. They provide hierarchical structure to the content, <br>with
                < h1> being the highest level and < h6> being the lowest level<br>
                < p>: The < p> tag is used to define paragraphs of text. It represents a
                standalone block of text</p></li>
            </ul>

<h2>18 what is SVG?</h2>
   <li><p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is an XML-based
    markup
    language used for describing two-dimensional vector graphics.<br>
    Unlike raster images (such as JPEG or PNG), which are made up
    of
    pixels,<br> SVG graphics are defined using mathematical equations
    and
    geometric shapes, <br>allowing them to be scaled and resized without
    losing image quality.
    features and advantages of SVG:<br>
    Scalability: SVG images can be scaled up or down without losing
    quality.<br>
    This makes them ideal for creating responsive designs
    that
    adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.<br>
    Vector-based: SVG images are defined using mathematical formulas
    and geometric shapes (lines, curves, polygons, etc.),<br>
    rather than pixels.<br>
    This allows for smooth curves and sharp edges,
    regardless
    of the image's size

                <h2>19 What is the difference between HTML and XHTML?</h2>
                <li><p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext
                    Markup Language) are both markup languages used for structuring and
                    presenting content on the web.<br>
                    While they share many similarities, there are some key differences
                    between<br>
                    HTML and XHTML<br>
                    syntax: HTML has a more lenient syntax, allowing for more flexibility and
                    tolerance for errors.<br>
                    XHTML, on the other hand, follows the stricter syntax rules of XML. It
                    requires well-formed and properly nested tags, attribute values enclosed
                    in
                    quotes, and self-closing tags for elements like < br> or < img>.

            <h2>20. What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</h2>
            <li><p>In HTML, the terms "logical tags" and "physical tags" are not standard
                terminology. However, I can provide an explanation based on how these
                terms might be interpreted in the context of HTM<br>L
                Logical Tags:<br>
                Logical tags refer to the semantic tags in HTML that describe the
                structure and meaning of the content, rather than focusing on
                the
                visual presentation. These tags provide information about the
                purpose and role of the content within the document. Some<br>
                examples of logical tags in HTML5 include < header>, < nav>, < main>,
                < section>, < article>, < aside>, < footer>, < h1> to < h6>, < p>, < ul>, < ol>, < li>,<br>
                Physical Tags:<br>
                Physical tags, on the other hand, might refer to the
                presentational<br>
                or formatting tags in older versions of HTML, such as HTML 4
                or
                earlier. <br>These tags were primarily used for defining the
                appearance or styling of the content, rather than its structure or
                meaning.<br>
                Examples of physical tags include < font>, < b>, < i>, < u>, < strike>, < centre> </p></li>
